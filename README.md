## 🚀 Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/password-strength-meter.git
   cd password-strength-meter
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   
   # On Windows
   venv\Scripts\activate
   
   # On macOS/Linux
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## 💻 Usage

1. Start the Streamlit application:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

2. Open your web browser and navigate to the URL displayed in your terminal (typically http://localhost:8501)

3. Enter a password in the input field and click "Check Password Strength" to see the analysis

## 🔧 How It Works

The application uses the zxcvbn library, developed by Dropbox, which employs pattern matching and frequency lists to evaluate password strength. The strength assessment considers factors such as:

- Password length
- Character variety (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols)
- Common patterns and sequences
- Dictionary words and names
- Known leaked passwords

Based on this analysis, the app provides:

1. A strength score (Weak, Normal, Strong)
2. Visual feedback with color-coded indicators
3. Specific warnings about detected vulnerabilities
4. Customized suggestions for improving password security

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Streamlit**: For the web application framework
- **zxcvbn-python**: For advanced password strength analysis
- **Python**: Core programming language
- **HTML/CSS**: For custom styling and animations
